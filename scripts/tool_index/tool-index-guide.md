# AI-Optimized Tool Index User Guide

## Overview

The AI-Optimized Tool Index is a structured metadata system that helps Claude make better decisions about tool selection and usage. It provides rich information about tools, their relationships, and proper usage patterns in a format that's specifically designed for AI consumption.

## Key Features

- **Tool Profiles**: Detailed metadata about each tool, including when to use it, when not to use it, and common error patterns
- **Relationship Mapping**: Information about how tools work together and common sequences
- **Decision Trees**: AI-optimized decision structures for tool selection
- **Context Validation**: Self-diagnostic mechanisms to verify Claude's understanding
- **Coding Limits**: Guidelines for recognizing when code complexity exceeds safe thresholds

## Installation

### Quick Install

1. Copy the installation script to your project directory:
   ```
   install_tool_index.py
   ```

2. Run the installer:
   ```bash
   python install_tool_index.py
   ```

3. The installer will:
   - Copy the necessary scripts to your project's `scripts` directory
   - Build the Tool Index in a `.tool_reference` directory
   - Output the results of the build process

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install the components manually:

1. Create a `scripts` directory in your project if it doesn't exist
2. Copy the following scripts to the `scripts` directory:
   - `tool_index_builder.py`
   - `tool_index_generator.py`
   - `tool_profiles_generator.py`
   - `tool_relationships_generator.py`
   - `context_validation_generator.py`
3. Run the builder script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/tool_index_builder.py --all
   ```

## Directory Structure

After installation, your project will have a `.tool_reference` directory with the following structure:

```
.tool_reference/
├── registry.json                 # Master index of all tools
├── categories.json               # Categorization of tools by purpose
├── relationship_*.json           # Tool relationships and dependencies
├── tool_profiles/                # AI-optimized tool profiles
│   ├── read_file.json            # Profile for read_file tool
│   ├── write_file.json           # Profile for write_file tool
│   └── ...
├── decision_trees/               # AI-optimized decision trees
│   ├── filesystem_operations.json # Decision tree for file operations
│   ├── code_analysis.json        # Decision tree for code analysis
│   └── ...
├── usage_patterns/               # Common usage patterns
│   ├── file_editing.json         # Patterns for file editing
│   ├── project_analysis.json     # Patterns for analyzing projects
│   └── ...
└── self_diagnostic/              # Self-diagnostic tools
    ├── context_validator.json    # Validates Claude's context against reality
    ├── execution_tracer.json     # Traces tool execution paths
    └── error_analyzer.json       # Analyzes common error patterns
```

## Usage

The Tool Index is designed to work automatically with Claude. Once installed, Claude will have access to the rich metadata whenever it's working on your project. This helps Claude make better decisions about:

1. Which tools to use in different scenarios
2. How to combine tools for common tasks
3. How to diagnose and recover from errors
4. When code complexity requires different approaches

### Testing the Context Validator

You can test the context validator tool to ensure Claude's understanding matches reality:

```bash
python scripts/context_validator.py --check all
```

This will verify that:
- Claude is connected to the correct server
- Tool execution paths are as expected
- Project structure understanding is accurate

## Customizing the Tool Index

### Adding Profiles for New Tools

1. Add the tool definition to `tool_profiles_generator.py`:
   ```python
   TOOL_PROFILES = {
       "my_new_tool": {
           "tool_id": "my_new_tool",
           "primary_purpose": "description of purpose",
           "execution_context": "execution requirements",
           "parameter_patterns": { ... },
           "always_use_when": [ ... ],
           "never_use_when": [ ... ],
           # Additional properties
       },
       # Other tool profiles
   }
   ```

2. Rebuild the Tool Index:
   ```bash
   python scripts/tool_index_builder.py --phase 2
   ```

### Adding Relationship Mappings

1. Add the relationship definition to `tool_relationships_generator.py`:
   ```python
   RELATIONSHIP_GROUPS = {
       "my_workflow": {
           "group_name": "my_workflow",
           "description": "Description of the workflow",
           "tools": ["tool1", "tool2", "tool3"],
           "common_sequences": [ ... ],
           "anti_patterns": [ ... ]
       },
       # Other relationship groups
   }
   ```

2. Rebuild the Tool Index:
   ```bash
   python scripts/tool_index_builder.py --phase 3
   ```

## Integration with TaskBoard

The Tool Index is designed to work seamlessly with the planned TaskBoard system:

1. TaskBoard can use the Tool Index to determine which mini-librarians to assign tasks to
2. Relationship mappings can inform task sequencing and dependencies
3. Error analysis patterns can help with task recovery strategies

When implementing the TaskBoard, you can access the Tool Index to make intelligent dispatching decisions.

## Benefits

By implementing the AI-Optimized Tool Index, you'll notice:

1. More consistent and appropriate tool selection by Claude
2. Better error handling and recovery
3. Clearer communication about tool capabilities
4. More accurate assessment of code complexity
5. Self-correction when Claude's understanding doesn't match reality

## Maintenance

The Tool Index is designed to be low-maintenance. However, you may want to update it when:

1. Adding new tools to your system
2. Discovering new common error patterns
3. Identifying new tool relationships or workflows
4. Adding context validation rules

To update, simply modify the relevant generator script and run the builder for that phase.
