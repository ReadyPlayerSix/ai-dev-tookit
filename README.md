## üåü Overview

AI Dev Toolkit elevates Claude beyond a conversational assistant to a comprehensive development partner. The toolkit creates a bidirectional bridge between your projects and Claude, enabling it to:

- **Understand your codebase** through persistent context that spans conversations
- **Access and modify your filesystem** with appropriate permissions
- **Track and manage development tasks** with sophisticated context awareness
- **Navigate between code and tools** with unified context awareness
- **Offload complex cognitive tasks** to specialized AI mini-librarians
- **Process long-running operations asynchronously** with the TaskBoard system
- **Analyze codebase security** with professional-level vulnerability assessment
- **Create a seamless development workflow** within Claude's interface

With this toolkit, Claude becomes a true development partner - remembering your project structure, understanding component relationships, connecting code to relevant tools, tracking tasks, and assisting with development activities.

All this happens automatically - just initialize once and the system handles everything behind the scenes, continuously updating its understanding of your codebase as it evolves. **You don't need to manually call any functions or understand the internal implementation - Claude handles all of this for you.**

## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development

This toolkit was developed with Claude's assistance, demonstrating the power of human-AI collaboration in creating developer tools. The project itself serves as an example of enhancing AI capabilities through specialized extensions.

Key AI-assisted development techniques used in this project:

- **Iterative Design**: Human-AI dialogue to refine architecture and interfaces
- **Context-Aware Coding**: Using AI Librarian to maintain project context
- **Specialized AI Agents**: Mini-librarians handling specific cognitive tasks
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into manageable chunks
- **Knowledge Integration**: Combining domain expertise with AI capabilities

## üîå Architecture

The AI Dev Toolkit uses a modular architecture built around the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to integrate with Claude:

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

> **Note:** The GUI components are currently under development. Command-line and code-based interactions are fully functional, while the graphical interface for directory selection and configuration is in beta phase.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important for Alpha/Pre-Beta Testers**: During this testing phase, please configure Claude Desktop to use **only the 17 recommended tools** for optimal performance. This is part of our ongoing efforts to streamline and optimize the tool count. You can disable other tools in the Claude Desktop settings or through the GUI configuration tool.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Claude Desktop (latest version) or Claude Code
- Git

### Option 1: Install AI Librarian Server for Claude Desktop (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/isekaizen/ai-dev-toolkit.git
cd ai-dev-toolkit

# Install dependencies (IMPORTANT: includes MCP package required for Claude Desktop)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Alternative: Install MCP specifically if above command fails
pip install mcp[cli]

# Install to Claude Desktop
python development/install_to_claude.py
```

> **IMPORTANT:** The MCP (Model Context Protocol) package is **required** for Claude Desktop integration. Without it, the server will run in limited functionality mode with no connection to Claude Desktop. See [MCP_INSTALLATION.md](MCP_INSTALLATION.md) for details.

### Option 2: Install with Claude Code (Newest)
```bash
# Using Claude Code's terminal:

# Get the installer script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isekaizen/ai-dev-toolkit/main/scripts/install_for_claude_code.py
# Or with curl:
# curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isekaizen/ai-dev-toolkit/main/scripts/install_for_claude_code.py

# Run the installer
python install_for_claude_code.py

# Follow the prompts to complete installation
```

The Claude Code installer will:
- Clone the repository from GitHub
- Install necessary dependencies
- Configure the toolkit for your project directories
- Set up CLAUDE.md for improved Claude Code interaction
- Create desktop shortcuts for the GUI (if tkinter is available)
- Install the Claude Code adapter for optimized performance

#### WSL Users (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

If you're using Claude Code in WSL, there are some special considerations:

```bash
# First ensure Python and pip are properly installed in your WSL environment
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv

# Navigate to your Windows project directory (typically mounted under /mnt/)
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/YourProjects
# or
cd /mnt/d/Projects

# Get the installer
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isekaizen/ai-dev-toolkit/main/scripts/install_for_claude_code.py

# Run the installer with your Windows project paths
# Make sure to specify the installation directory and allowed directories explicitly
python3 install_for_claude_code.py --install-dir "/mnt/d/YourProjects/ai-dev-toolkit" --allowed-dirs "/mnt/d/YourProjects" "/mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/OtherProjects"
```

**Important WSL Notes:**
- WSL users should ensure Python 3.8+ and pip are properly installed in their Linux environment
- Your projects will likely be on Windows drives mounted at /mnt/c/, /mnt/d/, etc.
- Always use absolute paths with the /mnt/ prefix for Windows drives
- If you see pip-related errors, try installing dependencies manually with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- For WSL users, the indexer works best on projects stored on Linux filesystems (not mounted Windows drives)

### Option 3: Use the Development Launcher
```bash
# After cloning and installing dependencies
python development/launch.py
```

Once installation is complete, the AI Dev Toolkit will enhance Claude's capabilities automatically. You don't need to execute any additional commands - just start talking to Claude about your project!

## üìä How to Use AI Dev Toolkit

Once installed, the AI Dev Toolkit works automatically in the background. Claude handles all the technical implementation details for you!

### Getting Started

Simply start a conversation with Claude and ask about your codebase. Here are some examples of what you can ask Claude to do:

- "Help me understand the structure of my project"
- "Find all implementations of the login function"
- "Create a task to refactor the authentication system"
- "Analyze the security of my codebase"
- "Help me debug this error message"
- "Examine the git history of this file"

The toolkit is designed to enhance Claude's capabilities without requiring you to learn or execute any Python code.

## üìù Claude's Technical Implementation

<details>
<summary><strong>Click here to see how Claude uses these tools internally</strong> (Technical details - users don't need to execute these commands)</summary>

**Important: All code examples below demonstrate how Claude uses these tools internally. These are NOT commands that you need to execute - Claude handles everything automatically!**

### Optimized Tool Usage to Avoid Timeouts

To ensure the best performance and prevent timeouts, Claude follows these hierarchical tool selection guidelines:

#### Hierarchical Tool Selection
Claude prioritizes tools in this order:

1. **Component Registry First**: Check `.ai_reference/component_registry.json` before filesystem operations
2. **Script Index Second**: Use `.ai_reference/script_index.json` to find specific files 
3. **Direct File Operations Last**: Only as a final resort when indexed data is unavailable

```python
# PREFERRED: Query component registry directly (fastest)
registry_path = f"{project_path}/.ai_reference/component_registry.json"
with open(registry_path, 'r') as f:
    registry = json.load(f)
component = registry["components"].get(component_name)

# If found, do targeted file reading
if component:
    file_path = component["primary_file"]
    # Now read just this specific file
```

#### For Code Searches
```python
# PREFERRED: Use script index to identify exact files to check
index_path = f"{project_path}/.ai_reference/script_index.json"
with open(index_path, 'r') as f:
    script_index = json.load(f)

# Find files containing target class/function
matches = []
for file_path, info in script_index["files"].items():
    if target_name in info["classes"] or target_name in info["functions"]:
        matches.append(file_path)
        
# Read only those specific files
```

#### For Long-Running Operations
```python
# Use TaskBoard for operations that might time out
task_id = submit_background_task(
    task_type="search",
    target_path=project_path,
    pattern=search_pattern
)
# Check status and get results when ready
task_result = get_task_result(task_id)
```

### AI Librarian & Unified Context

When you ask Claude to understand, analyze, or navigate your codebase, it's using these functions behind the scenes:

```python
# Initialize AI Librarian for a project
# This one command sets up everything - AI Librarian, Unified Context, and Tool References
initialize_enhanced_librarian("path/to/your/project")

# Search for code implementations
find_implementation("path/to/your/project", "login function")

# Query components
query_component("path/to/your/project", "MyClass")

# Find tools related to a specific component
find_related_tools("path/to/your/project", "AuthenticationManager")

# Find components related to a specific tool
find_related_components("path/to/your/project", "edit_file")

# Get a unified view of your project
get_unified_context("path/to/your/project")
```

#### Large Codebase Support

For larger codebases, Claude uses mini-librarians to provide efficient navigation and understanding:

```python
# Access mini-librarians directly (Claude Code)
read_file(".ai_reference/scripts/___aitoolkit_librarian_ai_dev_toolkit_py.json")

# Get component information from mini-librarians
get_component_details("path/to/project", "ComponentName") 

# Search across mini-librarians
search_mini_librarians("path/to/project", "function_name")
```

### Task Management

When you ask Claude to track tasks, it uses these functions internally:

```python
# Add a task
add_todo("path/to/project", "Implement login feature", priority="high")

# List tasks
list_todos("path/to/project")

# Update task status
update_todo_status("path/to/project", "todo-123", "completed")
```

### Advanced AI Task Management

For more sophisticated task tracking, Claude uses these advanced functions:

```python
# Create an AI-optimized task
add_ai_task("path/to/project", "Authentication system refactoring", "Improve security and performance", "refactor", 2)

# List AI tasks
list_ai_tasks("path/to/project", status="active", priority=1)

# Add detailed code context to a task
add_task_context(task_id, "code_snippet", "Task relates to authentication system")
```

### Think Tool

When handling complex reasoning tasks, Claude uses the Think Tool as a private scratchpad:

```python
# Use the think tool as a scratchpad for reflection
think("""
User wants to implement a new authentication feature.
- Required information:
  * User roles and permissions structure
  * Current authentication flow
  * Security requirements
- Implementation approach options:
  * Extend existing AuthManager
  * Create new specialized AuthProvider
  * Use third-party authentication library
- Considerations:
  * Performance impact
  * Security implications
  * Maintenance complexity
- Decision:
  * Extending existing AuthManager seems most appropriate
  * Need to add role validation logic
  * Will require unit tests for new functionality
""")

# For deeper, time-consuming analysis, use deep_analysis from the TaskBoard system
task_id = deep_analysis(project_path, "I need to understand how the authentication system works and its dependencies")
get_task_status(project_path, task_id)
get_task_result(project_path, task_id)
```

### File System Operations

Claude uses these functions to work with your project files:

```python
# Read a file
read_file("path/to/your/file.py")

# Write to a file
write_file("path/to/your/file.py", "file content")

# Edit bookmarks for complex code changes
bookmark_id = create_edit_bookmark("path/to/project", "path/to/file.py", 10, 25)
update_bookmark("path/to/project", bookmark_id, "new content for lines 10-25")
apply_bookmark("path/to/project", bookmark_id)

# List directory contents
list_directory("path/to/your/directory")

# Search for files
search_files("path/to/your/project", "pattern")

# Git repository tracking
git_info = get_git_info("path/to/your/project")
update_git_history("path/to/your/project", ".git_history")

# Project upgrading and analysis
from aitoolkit.utils.upgrade_manager import UpgradeManager

# Check if a project needs an upgrade
needs_upgrade, current, latest = UpgradeManager.needs_upgrade("path/to/project")

# Analyze a project structure and get recommendations
analysis = UpgradeManager.analyze_project("path/to/project")
recommendations = analysis["recommendations"]["recommendations"]

# Upgrade a project to the latest version
results = UpgradeManager.upgrade("path/to/project", backup=True)

# Or use the command-line tool
# python scripts/upgrade_ai_toolkit.py --analyze /path/to/project
# python scripts/upgrade_ai_toolkit.py /path/to/project
```

### Claude Code vs Desktop Functionality

Claude Code can simulate toolkit functionality through mini-librarians and adapter patterns:

| Feature | Claude Code | Claude Desktop |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| File Operations | Native tools + Simulated toolkit via adapters | MCP Server with direct toolkit access |
| Mini-Librarians | Direct JSON access and interpretation | Server API access |
| Task Management | Simulated through adapter patterns | Direct function calls |
| GUI Configuration | Command-line installer | Visual interface (Beta) |
| Large Codebase Handling | Native tools with mini-librarian guidance | Server-based processing (Beta) |
| Installation | One-command direct install | Requires Desktop config |
| Toolkit Functions | Simulated via adapter patterns in `.ai_reference` | Direct function calls |

#### Claude Code Adapter Patterns

Claude Code simulates toolkit functionality through adapter patterns stored in the `.ai_reference` directory:

```python
# Example: Instead of direct toolkit call like:
result = create_edit_bookmark("path/to/project", "path/to/file.py", 10, 25)

# Claude Code reads the adapter pattern and executes:
file_content = read_file("path/to/file.py")
content_to_edit = file_content.splitlines()[10:25]
# Store in memory for later application
session_bookmarks["bookmark1"] = {"file": "path/to/file.py", "start": 10, "end": 25, "content": content_to_edit}
```

### Security Analysis

For security analysis tasks, Claude uses these functions internally:

```python
# Run a comprehensive security analysis on your project
security_report = security_analyze("path/to/your/project")

# Enhanced sanity check with security analysis included
check_report = enhanced_sanity_check("path/to/your/project", include_security=True)
```

### Optimizing Performance and Handling Timeouts

Claude automatically implements these optimization strategies:

```python
# Initialize with robustness features automatically applied
# This is the recommended all-in-one initialization method
initialize_ai_dev_toolkit("path/to/your/project")

# For other long-running operations, robustness decorators are used
from aitoolkit.utils.tool_wrappers import make_robust

@make_robust(timeout=60.0, max_retries=2)
def my_search_function(query):
    # Implementation here
```

</details>

## üîç Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **‚ö†Ô∏è MCP Missing - Claude Desktop Cannot Connect**: If you see "Running in limited functionality mode without Claude Desktop connection" or similar, the MCP package is not installed. Fix with:
  ```bash
  pip install mcp[cli]
  ```
  Then restart the server. See [MCP_INSTALLATION.md](MCP_INSTALLATION.md) for detailed instructions.

- **Server Runs But No Claude Desktop Connection**: Verify that:
  1. MCP package is installed (`pip list | grep mcp`)
  2. Server is running with proper MCP initialization
  3. Claude Desktop config points to correct server path
  4. Timeout settings are correct (see MCP_INSTALLATION.md)

- **Toolkit Not Appearing in Claude**: Ensure configuration was saved correctly and Claude Desktop was restarted

- **Permission Errors**: Check allowed directories in the configuration

- **Connection Issues**: Verify Claude Desktop is properly configured and restart the server

- **Import Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed

- **File Access Problems**: Verify the server has appropriate permissions to access your files

- **Sanity Check Issues**: If experiencing problems with the sanity_check tool, use individual diagnostic tools like find_implementation() and query_component() as alternatives

- **Legacy Files**: Use `git clean -fd` after a `git reset --hard` to ensure all untracked files are removed when reverting to a previous version

- **Duplicate Files**: During our cleanup process, you may encounter duplicate files with extensions like .old, .backup, .fixed - these will be addressed in an upcoming release

- **find_related_files Tool Errors**: This tool has a known issue that will be fixed in an upcoming release

- **Timeout Errors**: We've improved timeout handling in version 0.5.4 with a more reliable threading-based mechanism and longer timeouts for search and write operations. We've also extended the MCP protocol timeout from 30s to 120s to prevent server disconnections. If you're still experiencing timeouts, try running `python install_for_claude_code.py` to upgrade your projects to the latest version.

- **Old .ai_reference Format**: For projects with older format .ai_reference directories, run the installer with `python install_for_claude_code.py` which will automatically detect and offer to upgrade these directories

- **Tool Timeout Performance Issues**: If tools are taking too long and timing out, use the hierarchical tool selection approach described in the "Optimized Tool Usage" section above. Always query the component registry and script index before doing direct filesystem operations.
