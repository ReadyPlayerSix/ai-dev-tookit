# AI-Optimized Tool Index

This directory contains an AI-optimized Tool Index for Claude, designed to enhance
its ability to select and use tools appropriately. The system is structured in a way
that's optimized for AI consumption rather than human readability.

## Directory Structure

- `registry.json` - Master index of all tools
- `categories.json` - Categorization of tools by purpose
- `relationship_*.json` - Tool relationships and dependencies
- `tool_profiles/` - Detailed metadata for each tool
- `decision_trees/` - Decision trees for tool selection
- `usage_patterns/` - Common usage patterns
- `self_diagnostic/` - Self-diagnostic mechanisms

## Purpose

This Tool Index helps Claude:
1. Select the most appropriate tool for a given task
2. Understand how tools should be used together
3. Recognize when it's approaching complexity limits
4. Validate its understanding against reality
5. Identify and correct errors in tool usage

The format is optimized for Claude's reasoning processes and is not intended to be
human-readable. It's a specialized knowledge base that Claude can query to improve
its tool-using capabilities.
