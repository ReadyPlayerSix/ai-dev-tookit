# Fix Tool Timeout Issues in MCP Server

## Summary
This commit addresses critical timeout issues that were preventing the AI Dev Toolkit MCP server from connecting to Claude Desktop. The main problems were:
- Syntax errors in task_board.py from a previous fix attempt
- Too many background threads consuming resources
- Insufficient timeout values for MCP communication

## Changes Made

### Core Fixes
1. **Fixed syntax errors** in `task_board.py`:
   - Corrected indentation issues
   - Added missing `_cancelled_tasks` set
   - Reduced default workers from 4 to 1

2. **Reduced background thread activity**:
   - Disabled unified context update thread
   - Changed daemon threads to non-daemon for cleanup
   - Increased update interval from 5 to 30 minutes

3. **Increased timeout values**:
   - MCP default timeout: 5 minutes (was 30 seconds)
   - File operations timeout: 10 minutes
   - Added heartbeat interval settings

### New Tools and Scripts
- `fix_timeouts.py` - Automated fix script
- `diagnose_timeout.py` - Diagnostic tool for thread issues
- `disable_problematic_modules.py` - Emergency fix script
- `start_server_safe.py` - Safe server startup script
- `resource_monitor.py` - Resource usage monitoring

### Documentation
- Created `timeout-prevention-guide.md` with detailed solutions
- Added Claude Desktop configuration example
- Updated tool reference files

## Test Results
- Server now connects successfully without timeouts
- Background operations no longer block tool execution
- Thread management improved with proper cleanup

## Recommendations
Users experiencing timeout issues should:
1. Run `scripts/disable_problematic_modules.py`
2. Restart Claude Desktop
3. Use the new diagnostic tools if issues persist
