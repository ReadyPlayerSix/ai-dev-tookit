# IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING MCP SERVER

## The ONLY MCP Server Being Used Is:
`aitoolkit/librarian/server.py`

This is the definitive MCP server for the AI Dev Toolkit. 

## NOT Being Used:
`aitoolkit/mcp/integrated_server.py`

The integrated_server.py file is NOT in use and should be considered deprecated.

Any references to integrated_server.py in the codebase should be considered incorrect and should be updated to use the proper MCP server implementation.
